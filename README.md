Contained in the repository are two reports of the same data analyzed and presented in Excel and Power BI.
The data contained is that of Germination Enegry (GE) and Capacity (GC).
Both GE and GC are quality assurance analysis performed to check if the barley crop is viable and meets requirements for malting barley.
GE (4ml) should be above 97% and GE (8ml) 80% for the barley to be malting barley and; germination capacity should be above 98%.


EXCEL DASHBOARD
The excel dashboard updates automatically as the data is updated on the worksheet. 
All results are displayed on a single graph.
Slicers enable the end-user to view results by silo name , bin number and cultivar (type of barley).

POWER BI
Visualizes all the results on one graph.
Slicers also enable the end-user to view results by silo name , bin number and cultivar (type of barley).
I can also automate it,  but for the sake of this exercise I did not.
